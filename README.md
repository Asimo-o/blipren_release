## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the **blipren_release** project! This software provides a simple way to train advanced models that understand both text and images. With this tool, you can create impressive applications in image captioning and more, without needing to dive deep into programming.

## 📦 Features

- **Vision-Language Model Training**: Train models to link images and text using our implementation of the BLIP-2 approach.
- **Colab-Ready Notebooks**: Easy-to-follow notebooks that work in Google Colab. No local setup is required.
- **Modular Design**: Implement various configurations like Q-Former and mixture-of-experts (MoE).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for all skill levels. Get started quickly, even without coding experience.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

To run this software, you will need:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- At least 4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended).
- An internet connection for downloading and setting up files.
- Basic knowledge of how to open files and navigate through folders.
